# MERN_Stack learning journey
I am Mahalakshmi K, and I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Achariya College of Engineering.
## Course Objective
The objective of this course is to learn MERN Stack full-stack web development. This course helps me understand both frontend and backend technologies. By learning MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, I can develop dynamic, responsive, and secure web applications. This course also improves my coding skills and prepares me for real-world software development.
## Stack Overview (MERN Stack)
MERN Stack is a combination of four JavaScript-based technologies used for full-stack web development.
**MongoDB is used to store application data in database form.**
**Express.js is used to create backend APIs and handle server**
## Day wise content
On Day 1, I learned the basics of web development and how websites work.
I studied the client–server architecture and the role of frontend and backend.
The introduction to MERN stack was explained.
I understood how MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js work together.
This day helped me get an overall idea of full-stack web development.
